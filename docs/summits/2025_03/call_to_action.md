# We need your help !

Thank you for attending this WheelNext Summit (or reading its website materials)!
Your participation in and contributions during and after this event matter -
we're collectively trying to achieve some ambitious goals, and we'll need all
the help we can get.

A first goal is community building - WheelNext is young, and we're rapidly trying
to pull together as many stakeholders as possible: companies, open source projects,
and individual Python packaging contributors. Meeting others with similar goals
and pain points helps collaborate in the future, and building an understanding
of pain points different from our own will lead to better discussions and
solutions.

Concretely, here are ways to contribute. During the event:

- Share your own goals, pain points, and ideas
- Pick one of the 3 workshops to attend and collaborate on a small concrete deliverable
- Find out how you can help accelerate WheelNext development (prototypes, PEPs,
  working out use cases & user stories, etc.)

After the event:

- Share news about WheelNext with others who might find it interesting or may want to pitch in
- Help review or improve PEP drafts, website materials, and other content
- Test current prototypes on your own use cases and provide feedback or fixes
- If you're a maintainer of a packaging-related tool: please think about how
  the designs being developed in WheelNext will be implemented in or affect
  your tool, and ensure you're happy with the design and impact of it!
- If you're a package author affected by limitations in Python packaging that
  seem in scope for WheelNext: please ensure that your use case is captured and
  addressed.
