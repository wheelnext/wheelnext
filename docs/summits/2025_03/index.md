# 2025 WheelNext Community Summit

## Abstract

NVIDIA & META are holding an invite-only event called “2025 WheelNext Community Summit”. It is a half-day event. We are
inviting community members to take the floor to provide feedback on their global experience of using hardware accelerated
products in Python and present it to the community.

Invitees will include AMD, Alphabet, Anaconda, Astral, Microsoft, OpenAI, Probabl, Quansight, RedHat and a few other
companies and open-source projects using accelerated products in Python such as AstroPy, Conda, Jax, Numba, NumFocus,
Numpy, PyTorch, RAPIDS, Scikit-Build, Scikit-Learn, Triton, UV, XGBoost, etc. - the scientific computing space in the
larger sense.

### SAVE THE DATE

March 21, 2025,  9AM-1.30PM @ META - Menlo Park, CA

## What is WheelNext and Why should you attend the summit !?

WheelNext is an open-source initiative (<https://github.com/wheelnext> & <https://wheelnext.dev/>) aiming to improve
the user-experience in the Python Ecosystem, specifically around the scientific computing and machine/deep learning
space. Python packaging was unfortunately not designed with the increasingly complex needs these use-cases are
demanding in mind. We hope to bring changes in Python Packaging standards to better the overall ecosystem.

Many problems are summarized on the following website: <https://pypackaging-native.github.io/>

### Objective

To improve the state of packaging for Python native code, making it easier to build, distribute, and install
Python packages with native dependencies.

### Approach to Proposed Solutions

- **Unified Approach:** Developing a more unified and standardized approach to packaging native code in Python.
- **Improved Tooling:** Enhancing existing tools and creating new ones to simplify the process.
- **Better Documentation:** Providing comprehensive and clear documentation to help developers navigate the packaging landscape.
- **Engineering Focus:** Putting the work and the effort to build and propose clear solutions that fixes the
aforementioned issue in the most holistic manner.

## Focus of the Summit

- **Inform** the community of the current ongoing work
- **Detail** the technical proposal WheelNext contributors have been working on.
- **Gather feedbacks** from the community on the roadmap and proposals
- **Engage** the community to contribute to the verticals WheelNext is addressing.

Please let us know if you are interested in attending the summit or collaborating with us on these topics in the future.

We hope to you at the summit very soon !
