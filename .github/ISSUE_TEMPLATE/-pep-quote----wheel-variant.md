## *Who* are you ?
<!-- Ex. Independant researcher, core contributor to XYZ. -->

## *What* is the project you represent - 1-2 lines summary of what this project is about ?
<!-- Ex. I represent `mypackage`, we focus on doing cool stuff. -->

## *Quote* you would like to provide for the "Wheel Variant PEP":
<!-- 
We are looking for quotes from the Python community highlighting:
- how does "not having Wheel Variant" impact you and your project: pain points
- how this proposal would help your package to grow: why you want this
- how this proposal would make your users' life better / easier: how does it improve UX
- anything you believe relevant that makes "Wheel Variant" attractive to you.

It will be integrated in the PEP draft and we will confirm with you before the publication
for approval.
